1) Add Texture manager so that I dont have to do "reserve" at the beginning of the demos and hope the array doesnt get resized.
(models keep a reference to each textures as a pointer. I should be an ID, or a linked list. Although linked list could lower performance)


3) Write a general instanced renderer that takes all the objects it needs to draw at each frame and draw them. Now for each "type" of object
I have an instancedSet object that draws them.
